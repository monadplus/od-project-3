** Project setup

There subdirectory [[file:graphdb-docker/][graphdb-docker]] contains all you need to run graphDB inside a docker image. Read the README since you need to download =graphdb-free-9.7.0-dist.zip= from their website (the size of the file is 200 MB which is bigger than the allowed since by github).

#+begin_src
cd graphdb-docker
docker-compose up --detach
#+end_src

** Create TBox & ABox

#+begin_src sh
pip install cython
pip install owlready2
cd src
python3 abox.py
#+end_src

** Check your TBox is sound

#+begin_src sh
cd src
python3 reasoner.py
#+end_src

You can generate only the TBox:

#+begin_src sh
cd src
python3 tbox.py
#+end_src


** Load the ontology into GraphDB

Simple, open graphDB (recall to start it using our docker image) crate a repository

#+begin_src
Repository ID: publications
Ruleset: OWL2-SQL (Optimized)
#+end_src

and import =publications.rdf= (contains both the TBox and ABox).

#+begin_src
Base IRI: http://localhost:7200/publications
Target graphs: From data
#+end_src

The process took 19 seconds on a /Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz/.
