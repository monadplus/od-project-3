* Knowledge Graphs

** Project setup

There subdirectory [[file:graphdb-docker/][graphdb-docker]] contains all you need to run graphDB inside a docker image. Read the README since you need to download =graphdb-free-9.7.0-dist.zip= from their website (the size of the file is 200 MB which is bigger than the allowed since by github).

#+begin_src
cd graphdb-docker
docker-compose up --detach
#+end_src

** Create TBox & ABox

#+begin_src sh
pip install cython
pip install owlready2
cd src
python3 abox.py
#+end_src

** Check your TBox is sound

#+begin_src sh
cd src
python3 reasoner.py
#+end_src

** Load the ontology into GraphDB

Simple, open graphDB (recall to start it using our docker image) and
create a repository and import the =src/out/publications.rdf=.
